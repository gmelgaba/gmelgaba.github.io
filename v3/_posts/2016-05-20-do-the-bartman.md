Do the Bartman.

Do the Bartman!

Everybody back and forth, from side to side.

Do the Bartman.

Do the Bartman!

Pick your feet up off the floor, let 'em glide!

Do the Bartman.

Do the Bartman!

She can do it, he can do it, so can I.

Do the Bartman.

Do the Bartman!

Now here's a dance beat that you can't deny.
